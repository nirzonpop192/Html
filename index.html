			pCloud is not your traditional cloud storage provider; it is one of the very few ones who provide you with a lifetime storage subscription which means that you only have to pay once to get, well, 2TB of storage.
			To prevent abuse, you also get 2TB of download link traffic per month.
			Photographers will love the fact that you can see thumbnails and previews of most RAW files in the web and mobile versions of pCloud, as well as in pCloud Drive for macOS and there's even an official pCloud plugin for Lightroom that makes it possible to upload photos directly to your pCloud account.
			Also nifty is the browser extension that allows you to save videos and images directly to your pCloud account, which you can use as a scrapbook.<br/>
			Remember as well that you will be able to keep file revisions for up to 30 days and that you can create an entire static HTML website with its own URL.<br/></p>

		Easy to useStores any file typeProven legacyExpensive Dropbox is great for storing pretty much any digital file type.<br/>
		Organising files is a cinch thanks to the intuitive folder system, plus you can access your files on the go with apps for iOS and Android.<br/>
		All this and 2GB of storage is free with a Dropbox Basic account (you can get an extra 500MB of space for referring a friend up to 16GB).<br/>
		A Dropbox Plus account offers 2TB for $9.99 (£7.50) a month or $99 (£74) a year, and you can get 1GB per referral (up to 32GB) .<br/>
		You do get remote desktop wipe, 30-day version history, priority email upload and the option to restore folders or your entire account to a specific point in time, in a case of accidental file deletion, crashes, and similar disasters.<br/>
		For its versatility and simplicity, Dropbox is superb, especially if you just need to store RAW files.
